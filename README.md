# Code Red

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind "Code Red" is to provide a mobile application that assists women in managing their menstrual cycles and addresses emergency needs for menstrual products. The app aims to create a supportive community where women can discreetly communicate their urgent requirements for menstrual products and find assistance from others willing to share their spare products.

## What it does

"Code Red" provides functionality for:

1. Emergency requests for menstrual products: Users can create requests for menstrual products, specifying the type of product needed and the urgency level.
2. Nearby users willing to share: The app connects with nearby users who have indicated their willingness to share spare menstrual products, facilitating a community-based support system.
3. In-app messaging platform: The app provides an anonymous and secure in-app messaging platform, allowing users to communicate with each other regarding the requests and potential product sharing.
4. Product availability notifications: Users receive notifications about the availability of requested menstrual products, helping them find the needed items more efficiently.
5. User reviews and ratings: The app allows users to provide feedback and rate their experiences with product sharing, promoting transparency and accountability within the community.
6. Privacy and security measures: The app prioritizes the privacy and security of users' personal information, ensuring that all communications and interactions are protected.

## How we built it

The "Code Red" app can be built using the following technical components:

1. Mobile App Development: The app was built using the cross-platform framework Xamarin, enabling development for both iOS and Android platforms.
2. Backend Development: The backend was developed using the framework ASP.NET Core, implementing secure user authentication, profile management, and database management.
3. Database Management: The database was planned to be done through Appwrite API endpoints.

## Challenges we ran into

During the development of "Code Red," some potential challenges could include:

1. Authenticating with Appwrite API to perform CRUD operation on our database instance.
2. Verifying with OAuth API to provide seamless login functionality for users.
3. Ensuring user privacy and data security while facilitating anonymous communication.
4. Implementing an efficient matching algorithm to connect users with available product providers nearby.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Some potential accomplishments that the team could be proud of regarding "Code Red" include:

1. Creating a platform that addresses the urgent needs of women during their menstrual cycles and fosters a supportive community.
2. Developing a secure and anonymous messaging platform that enables open discussions and coordination of product sharing.
3. Fostering accessibility by providing cross-platform support of our application (iOS and Android).

## What we learned

While working on "Code Red," the team might have learned several valuable lessons, such as:

1. The importance of user privacy and data security in a sensitive app like this.
2. The challenges and considerations involved in building a community-driven platform with features like emergency requests and discreet sharing.
3. The technical aspects of integrating location services and ensuring user anonymity.
4. The significance of creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that caters to the target audience's needs.
